### Description

I have noticed recently, how many people have been going into the discussion forums and asking how to use databases.

well, this is a very simple example of how to manipulate data within databases

Functions include add, edit, and delete records, and a search by surname.

this code is fully commented.

please comment on this upload, as i would like to know what you think, and if you think there is a better way of doing certain things, argue it out all you like!
